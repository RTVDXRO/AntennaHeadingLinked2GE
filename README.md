These are the files used to link a common Antenna Rotor to Google Earth
For an overview of this project, please see YouTube Video found at:

There is now a second set of files (Arduino sketch, and eagle circuit diagram) that supports
interfacing with an 8 wire CDE HAM III rotator control. 
The Python and Google Earth KLM files are the same for either interface
